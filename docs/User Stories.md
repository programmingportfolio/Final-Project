##As a user I should be able to buy products, download products, add subscriptions to my account, post comments, make payments, contact customer service

1. I should have a page I go to where I can contact customer service and get to the appropriate department to save myself time. I would expect it to be very easy to understand.
2. As a customer of sofware products, I want to make sure that my products over time will still accept my license keys as the company ages. I want them to last forever.
3. I want to be able to access subscription items that I paid for.
4. I want to be able to post comments places so I can leave feedback and engage with other interesting customers.
5. I need to make sure that all of my payment information is safe. That is always my main concern as a customer. I wouldn't consider it a real website otherwise.


##As a manager I need to be able to, moderate other managers, create products, edit products, save product information in "drafts", view customer service in as a super user that require manager attention.

1. I need to be able to create products, have those products have a manager id attached to it.
2. I need to be able to moderate other managers, which may require a separate team. Be in some way able to still be able to contribute to that team
3. I need to be able to edit products and have the last person who edited it have their ID attached to it, with a commit message, and reason for editing. I also want to know if my own product was edited and why. I am specifically in charge of the electronics department.
4. I need my data to be backed up seamlessly at all times and have products saved in drafts incase I am not ready to publish them.
5. I need to view customer service and see what problems need management assistance only.

##As a customer service representative I need to be able to view customer concerns. I want to be assigned to a speciic department, be able to solve cases if they are solved, would prefer to have different customers each time.

1. I would like to view customer concerns that require my attention.
2. I want to be assigned to a specific department so I can save time on solving problems.
3. I would like the ability to solve cases when they are solved.
4. I would prefer to have different customers each time so that incase I wasn't able to solve the issue the first time another representative might be able to.

##As an editor I want to be able to create pages for the website, create content on those pages such as written text.

1. As a contributor I want to be able to create pages like blog pages.
2. I want to be able to create content on those pages such as pictures, videos, and text.

##As an moderator I want to be able to moderate user comments, moderate manager comments, approve contributor content, and deal with these issues through customer service.

1. As a moderator I need to deal with user comments and if they are flagged for some reason, briefly investigate it, if for some reason they were approved.
2. My main concern will be moderating management flagged concerns and contributor content. This could have the greatest source of impact on the company.
3. I want this all displayed through customer service but also have my own special page that only deals with these issues of moderation.
